# Find Closing Price Reversal with Alerts

This expert advisor, named 'Find Closing Price Reversal with Alerts', is designed to detect potential reversal patterns in the market based on the closing price. It is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com).

## Input Parameters

- `gapSize`: Size of the gap in points. Default value is 5.
- `barCheckCount`: Number of bars to check for potential reversal pattern. Default value is 3.

## Usage

This expert advisor works by iterating through the historical price data and checking for potential reversal patterns. It follows a specific set of conditions to identify a reversal pattern:

1. It checks if the absolute difference between the closing price of the previous bar and the opening price of the current bar is greater than or equal to `gapSize` multiplied by the point value.

2. It checks if the opening price of the current bar is higher than the highest price of the previous bar.

3. It checks if the closing price of the current bar is lower than the closing price of the previous bar.

4. It checks if the closing price of the current bar is lower than the lowest price of the current bar.

If all these conditions are met, it considers it as a potential reversal pattern and triggers an alert. The alert is shown only once to prevent multiple alerts.

The expert advisor can be used on any currency pair and timeframe. It is recommended to optimize the input parameters for different trading instruments and market conditions.
